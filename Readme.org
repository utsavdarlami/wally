* Wallpaper updater

Wallpaper Updater is a Python script that reads text from a file and adds the text to an image. The resulting image is then set as the wallpaper. The script can be run as a daemon service, so that the wallpaper is updated automatically when the text file is saved.

* Prerequisites

- Python 3.10.1
- systemd (for running the script as a daemon service)

* Installation

1. Install Python 3.6 or higher, if not already installed.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/wallpaper-updater.git
   #+END_SRC

3. Navigate to the `wallpaper-updater` directory:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cd wallpaper-updater
   #+END_SRC

4. Install the package using pip from requirements.txt:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt 
   #+END_SRC


5. Edit the `config.ini` file to specify the path to the text file and the image file, and other settings as needed.

6. If you want to run the script as a daemon service, copy the `wallpaper_updater.service` file to `/usr/local/lib/systemd/user/` and run the following commands:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl start wallpaper_updater
   sudo systemctl enable wallpaper_updater
   #+END_SRC

* Usage

To run the script manually, simply run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python wallpaper_updater.py
#+END_SRC

If you have set up the script as a daemon service, it will run automatically in the background.

* Configuration

The `config.ini` file contains the following settings:

- `text_file`: the path to the text file.
- `image_file`: the path to the image file.
- `font_file`: the path to the font file (optional).
- `font_size`: the size of the font (optional).
- `font_color`: the color of the text (optional).

You can customize these settings to your liking.
